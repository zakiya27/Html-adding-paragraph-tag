HTML Paragraphs

The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph:
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p> 

HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
Don't forget to end the tag or it will continue as the same tag we are using.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.
</p>
Output:
This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it. 
<p>
This paragraph
contains      a lot of spaces
in the source     code,
but the    browser 
ignores it.
</p>
Output:
This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it. 
And here is how you add paragraph tag in a full HTML code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Paragraph Tag</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>Hello! How are you doing?</p>
  </body>
  </html>
